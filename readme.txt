[center][color=red][size=16pt][b]Count Number of Own Posts in Topic View[/b][/size][/color][/center]

This MODification allows you to dynamically display, for each topic, the number of posts by the user currently viewing the MessageIndex.
Please note that:
- You need to have "Participation icons" enabled: Administration Center » Posts and Topics » Topic Settings
- In order to save space, the "Replies" and "Views" texts are removed and the respective numbers are shown side-by-side, separated with a slash. Please look at the sample images.
- As the MOD changes MessageIndex.template.php, it is possible that this will not install cleanly in some custom themes.
